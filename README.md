Road line detection for self-driving cars via Image Processing with AI.

# Road Line Detection

This repository contains a Python script, `road_line_detection.py`, which is designed to detect road lines in images or video streams. This script can be used as a foundational technology for various applications, including autonomous driving assistance systems.

## Description

The `road_line_detection.py` script processes visual input to identify and highlight road lines. It applies image processing techniques and computer vision algorithms to detect the patterns and markers that constitute road lines.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

Ensure Python is installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. If not, you can install them using the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Installation
Clone the repository to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/road-line-detection.git
```
Navigate to the repository's directory:
```
cd road-line-detection
```

## Usage
Run the script from the command line by navigating to the directory where the script is located and executing:
```
python road_line_detection.py
```

The script will process the specified input source and output an image or video stream with road lines marked.

## Features

- Line detection in different lighting and weather conditions.
- Ability to process static images as well as real-time video streams.
- Customizable parameters to fine-tune the detection algorithm.

## Libraries Used

- **OpenCV**: For real-time computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: For handling array operations.
